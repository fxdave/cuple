# Anatomy of Request handlers

## Basics

Here's a very basic request handler:
```ts
builder.get(async () => {
    return {
        result: 'success' as const,
        statusCode: 200 as const,
        message: "Hey!"
    }
})
```

 - The `builder` is the request handler builder that you've created during the installation.
 - The `.get` sets the final middleware with the appropriate HTTP method.
    - The supported methods are: `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`
 - The `async () => { /* ... */ }` is the function where your controller logic leaves
    - The return type should contain these fields:
        - `result`: a unique const indentifier for each possible responses.
        - `statusCode`: the HTTP status code. For client-side typing it needs to be const as well.

## Response factory methods

Adding `result` and `statusCode` manually can be noisy.
It's advised to create factory methods for common response types like `success`.

`success` is included in the package:

```ts
import { success } from '@cuple/server'

builder.get(async () => {
    return success({ message: "Hey!" })
})
```

Cuple needs validationErrors internally, so you can access these as well:

```ts
import { validationError } from '@cuple/server'

builder.get(async () => {
    return validationError({
        message: "We found some issues with your request"
    })
})
```

```ts
import { zodValidationError } from '@cuple/server'

builder.get(async () => {
    return zodValidationError([{
        code: "custom",
        path: ["password2"],
        message: "Passwords do not match.",
    }]);
})
```

And there's also a generic `apiResponse` method, so you don't have to keep track the shape of the return type:


```ts
import { apiResponse } from '@cuple/server'

builder.get(async () => {
  return apiResponse("not-found-error", 404, {
    message: "Resource not found",
  });
})
```

Example for custom factory method:
```ts
export function notFoundError(others?: {message: string}) {
  return apiResponse("not-found-error", 404, {
    message: others?.message || "Resource not found",
  });
}
```

## Access Request and Response object

The first argument is an object containing 3 elements:
    -   **req**: Express' Request object
    -   **res**: Express' Response object
    -   **data**: custom data from the middlewares

```ts
builder
    .chain(auth)
    .bodySchema(
      z.object({
        oldPassword: z.string(),
        password1: z.string().min(6),
        password2: z.string().min(6),
      }),
    )
    .post(async ({ req, res, data }) => {
        
        // You can access request object
        req.body

        // but you have better, type-safe way to deal with the incoming data
        data.body.password1

    })
```
