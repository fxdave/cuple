# Client chaining (Middleware)

You don't have to specify authorization header every time.
With client chaining, you can get a new client that includes the necessary parameters for every request.

## Example

```ts
const client = createClient<typeof routes>({
  path: "http://localhost:8080/rpc",
});

const authedClient = client.with(() => ({
  headers: {
    authorization: localStorage.getItem("token") || "nothing",
  },
}));

// GOOD:
await authedClient.getProfile.get({});

// THIS IS ALSO GOOD:
await client.getProfile.get({
  headers: {
    authorization: localStorage.getItem("token") || "nothing",
  },
});

// BAD EXAMPLE:
// Calling the handler which requires auth headers without auth headers cause type error:
await client.getProfile.get({}); // TYPE ERROR
```

 - NOTE: `with` can handle async callbacks, which will be evaluated every time you make a request.
 - NOTE: Having more than one chain link is experimental.
