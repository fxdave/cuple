# Generic Error Handlers

It's up to you how you handle errors coming from the API.

The response is a **discriminated union** including all possible responses from the server.
So you have to check whether the response is an error every time.
This can be cumbersome to do, so it's recommended to have a generic error handler that you can use for typical cases.

Note: It's planned to make a ready-to-use error-handling solution.

## Example

```ts
// foo.ts
async function createUser(email: string) {
    unwrapWithErrorNotification(await client.user.create({
        body: { email }
    }))
}
```

```ts
/** When the response is an error make a notification. */
export function unwrapWithErrorNotification<T extends { statusCode: number }>(
  response: T,
) {
  if (response.statusCode < 300) return response;
  const message = hasMessage(response) ? response.message : 'Something went wrong.'
  toast(message, { type: 'error' }); // react-toastify
  return response;
};

export function hasMessage(object: any): object is { message: string } {
  return !!object['message'];
}
```

Similarly to this you can make
 - `unwrapWithSuccessNotification` for notifying when it's success but you'd like to handle errors differently than notifying the user.
 - `unwrapWithNotification` for both success and errors
 - `unwrap` for crashing the page if it's not success response, so you will need to worry only about the the good case.

You can also make your own `useQuery` function and integrate proper error handling into them.
